/*
An object with the same name as a class is called a companion object.
Conversely, the class is the objectâ€™s companion class.
A companion class or object can access the private members of its companion.
Use a companion object for methods and values which are not specific
 to instances of the companion class.

 If a class or object has a companion, both must be defined in the same file
